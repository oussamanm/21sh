*** interpreter & compiler

*Lexical Analysis : 
    is the first phase of a compiler , it takes the modifies sources
    form language preprocessors that are written in the form of senteces.
    - the LA breaks these syntaxes into a series of tokens, by removing 
    any whitespace or comments in the source code.
    ex: int value = 100; ==> int (keyword), value (identidier), = (operator) ...
    (the compiler breaks the submitted source code into meaningful elements 
    called LEXEMES and generates a sequence of TOKENS from the lexemes)

*Parsing || syntactic analysis || syntax analysis :
    during syntax analysis the compiler use the sequence of tokens to generate
    a tree-like data structure called Abstract Syntax Tree, AST
    is also the phase where eventual syntax errors are detected and reported

*Semantic Analysis :
    During semantic analysis , the compiler uses the AST ot check if the program
    is consistent with all the rules of the source programming language.
    - semantic analysis encompasses :
        . Type inference = check if a type is successfully inferred.
        . Type checking : check that all value being assigned to vrb have the correct type
        . Symbol management : the compiler maintains a data structure called symbol table
            which contains information about all symbol (or names)
            the compiler use the symbol table to answer questions such as is this vrb declared
            use ? are there 2 vrb with the same names...

* Intermediate Code generation
    teh compiler uses the annotated AST to generate an intermediate  and machine-independent 
    low-level code.


pre preprocessor
compiler
assembler : machine code
linker : tool is used to link all the part of program together for execution
loader : load all of them into memory and the the program is executed
memory


*Quoting : used to remove the special meaning of certain character or words to the shell
