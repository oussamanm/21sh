**Termcap
    - Edit the line where the cursor is located.
    - Move the cursor left and right to be able to edit the line at a specific location. Obviously new characters have to be inserted between the existing ones similarly to a classic shell.
    - Line edition feature
        . Read from cmd line {printabel / non printabel}
        . fill list_dim
    - The ctrl+D et ctrl+C
    - Use up and down arrows to navigate through the command history which we will then be able to edit if we feel like it (the line, not the history)
    - Cut, copy, and/or paste all or part of a line using the key sequence you prefer.      
    - Move directly by word towards the left or the right using ctrl+LEFT and ctrl+RIGHT
        or any other reasonable combination of keys.
    - Go directly to the beginning or the end of a line by pressing home and end.
    - Write AND edit a command over a few lines. In that case, we would love that ctrl+UP and ctrl+DOWN allow to go from one line to another in the command
        while remaining in the same column or otherwise the most appropriate column.

**Pipe and Redirection
    - Completely manage quotes and double quotes, even on several lines (expansions
    excluded).
    - The “;” command line separator
    - Pipes “|”
    - The 4 following redirections “<”, “>”, “<<” et “>>”
    - File descriptor aggregation, for example to close the standard error output:

list_dimention
    - index_curso
    - nbr line
    - nbr cln = tab_max
    - addr_rows 


    .....*-....
    012345678|9
    012345678|19
    012345678|29

    nbr_cln = 9;

    10/9=0

    12 / 9 = row : 1

    index_cur = 5 => 6
    i_temp = 5

    sum = 5 + 6 > 10

    nbr_cln   = 10


c = 15   + 7 = 22
r = 0

r = 1 = 22 / 20
c = 2 = 22 % 20
